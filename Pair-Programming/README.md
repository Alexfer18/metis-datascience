Pair Programming
--

Here are the python (and sometimes iPython Notebook) files of the pair programming
assignments that I've worked on. They are ordered by date, include the prompt
in the header of the file, and a brief description of our approach when
appropriate. Enjoy!

If you have any ideas or suggestions that can improve these problems, I'd love
to hear them!
