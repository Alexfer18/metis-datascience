Pair Problem

You are given a list of numbers.

You want to find the block of numbers next to one another that add up to the biggest value for this list.

For example, if you have a list of 100 numbers, the answer could be that the numbers in positions 2 to 14 give the biggest sum, bigger than the sum for the numbers in positions 2 to 15 or 1 to 14 or 1 to 100 or any other such block of numbers that are next to one another.

Write code to find the optimal block for a given list of numbers.

Make sure your code runs in linear time.

Could be 1 number. Could be entire list. Numbers can be negative.
