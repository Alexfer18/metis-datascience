# Metis Data Science Bootcamp - Winter '16

This repository consists of data science projects and programming code that I
worked on at the winter 2016 cohort.

Here's what you can find in this repository:

#### [Pair Programming](https://github.com/ozzieliu/metis-datascience/tree/master/Pair-Programming)
Every morning we pair up with someone in the class and work on a programming
problem together. Here I document each problem, our approach, and the resulting
code for each exercise.

#### [Investigation](https://github.com/ozzieliu/metis-datascience/tree/master/Investigation)
Investigations are a chance for students to introduce an interesting application
of machine learning and data science.

In my first investigation, I presented some of my work experiences as
a data science intern at an insurance company, and projects related to text
mining and news analytics. In addition, I introduced Natural Language Processing
with Python's NLTK with a live demonstration.

You can find my blog post on this investigation [here]. And more details in the
Investigation folder.

#### [Challenges](https://github.com/ozzieliu/metis-datascience/tree/master/Challenges)
Challenges are problem sets on topics that we're learning about.  
Challenge 1 is an exploratory data analysis on the MTA's public turnstile data.  
Challenge 2 uses Pandas to analyze movie box office data.


#### [Projects](https://github.com/ozzieliu/metis-datascience/tree/master/Projects)
Just as it says, these are projects that I've worked on at Metis.  
Project 1 uses NYC subway data to help a non-profit find the best subway stations
to place street teams.
